#Libraries and Components
As the specifications became more featureful and the community of developers and their many use cases grew, the need for compassable software libraries capable of managing backwards compatibility and providing utility functions on top of the APIs became more clear.

The Software Developers Interest Group, one of the several sub-communities with the IIIF ecosystem, has begun publishing these libraries on [github](https://github.com/viewdir), along with documentation for [getting started](https://viewdir.github.io/).

The most mature is [Manifesto](https://github.com/viewdir/manifesto), a javascript library which wraps the presentation API for front-end and backend handling.
