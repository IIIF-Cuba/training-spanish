# Why do you want to use IIIF?

Many libraries, archives, organizations, and museums store and provide access to images. Images transmit scholarship, culture, and understanding. There are a lot of great reasons to adopt IIIF, first and foremost, you don't need to keep solving common problems[^1].

  - I am locked into my image delivery software
  - I need a newer, faster image server
  - I want deep zoom
  - I want to allow users to visually compare objects in the collection
  - I want to make it easy for my users to cite and share my images
  - I want to allow visitors to annotate my images online
  - I want to allow embedding of my images in blogs and web pages

These things should not have to be invented each time.

## IIIF aims to solves these problems (and others)

IIIF aims to solve these problems (and others) by providing standards, a community of practice, software creators, and content providers.

By collaboration in this manner, we are able to create more tools, better software, and gain access to more content.
